# Themes

Note: these themes go best with the Comic Sans MS font.  
Note: magenta has been removed from gaycord, but I'm too lazy to redo the gifs.

[Discord (gaycord)](./gaycord.css)  
[Firefox (gayfox)](./gayfox.css)  
[Google (gaygle)](./gaygle.css)

# HALP!? How install?!?

## Websites

2. Go to the site that the style is made for

## Gaycord (bad version) (electron / desktop app)
[DiscoCSS (Linux-only)](https://github.com/mlvzk/discocss)  
powercord / betterdiscord / something else, PR if you wanna fix this section.

Remember to remove the first/last lines in this case.


## gayfox
1. Enable `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` in `about:config`
2. Go to your profile directory by going to `about:support` and looking for "Profile Directory"
3. Once you're in that dir, make a subdir called `chrome`
4. In the `chrome` subdir, put the contents of `gayfox.css` into a file called `userChrome.css` (With those capitals)
5. Restart firefox
